    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your bowl and fill with enough kale that its sitting over the bowl a bit</li>
        <li>Generously add lemon juice and salt you only need one but both of them are great</li>
        <li>add garlic after crushing and getting that normal garlic smell</li>
        <li>Wash hands then start vigorously crushing all your kale by hand the salt and lemon juice will help this process and make the leaves look small and even watery if you omitted the lemon juice</li>
        <li>wash the remaining kale off your hands and taste a piece to make sure most of the bitterness is gone</li>
        <li>add all other ingredients and then mix them all up before adding the dressing</li>
